    title: 'How to Save Money on Your Next Vehicle Rental',
    excerpt: 'Smart tips and tricks to get the best rates on your rentals. Learn about off-peak booking, longer rental discounts, and loyalty programs.',
    content: `
Vehicle rentals don't have to break the bank. With these smart strategies, you can enjoy great rides while keeping your wallet happy.

## Booking Strategies

### 1. Book in Advance
Last-minute bookings are typically 20-30% more expensive. Plan ahead and book at least a week in advance for the best rates.

### 2. Choose Off-Peak Times
- **Weekday rentals** are often cheaper than weekends
- **Off-season travel** means lower demand and better prices
- **Avoid holidays** when prices spike

### 3. Longer Rentals = Better Rates
Most agencies offer significant discounts for weekly or monthly rentals. A 7-day rental might cost only 5x the daily rate.

## Smart Choices

### 4. Pick the Right Vehicle
- Rent what you need, not what you want
- Smaller vehicles are cheaper to rent AND fuel
- Consider fuel efficiency for longer trips

### 5. Compare Multiple Agencies
Use comparison platforms (like RentKaro!) to find the best deals across multiple agencies.

### 6. Check for Coupons and Offers
- First-time user discounts
- Seasonal promotions
- Credit card offers
- Loyalty program benefits

## Hidden Cost Avoidance

### 7. Avoid Airport Rentals
Airport locations often charge premium rates. Consider picking up from a city location.

### 8. Understand the Fuel Policy
Full-to-full is usually the most economical option. Avoid pre-paid fuel unless you're sure you'll use it all.

### 9. Skip Unnecessary Add-ons
- Evaluate if you really need GPS (use your phone)
- Check if your credit card provides rental insurance
- Skip child seats if you can bring your own

## Pro Tips

- **Be flexible** with pickup/dropoff times
- **Join loyalty programs** for accumulated benefits
- **Negotiate** for long-term rentals
- **Review carefully** before confirming

Happy saving! 💰
